# Full-Stack-Logger
## Description
Rather than throwing errors or using print statements, we can use services such as Log4j to manage our error messages and warnings.
This project is a full stack manager of logs. The logs are stored on a server and there is a GUI to manage logs or download log statistics.

## Preconditions
 - Install Maven
 - Use Linux or Mac

## How to run
From the Server project:
- To start the server: 
`mvn jetty:run`

From the Client project (*more information in the Client README*):
- Run the Log Monitor executable
- Run the Log Generator executable
